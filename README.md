# NetLogo Array Extension

## Building

Use the netlogo.jar.url environment variable to tell sbt which NetLogo.jar to compile against (defaults to NetLogo 5.3). For example:

    sbt -Dnetlogo.jar.url=file:///path/to/NetLogo/target/NetLogo.jar package

If compilation succeeds, `array.jar` will be created.

## Using

The array extension is pre-installed in NetLogo.

To use the array extension in your model, add a line to the top of your Code tab:

```
extensions [array]
```

If your model already uses other extensions, then it already has an
`extensions` line in it, so just add `array` to the list.

see the [Extensions Guide](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/extensions.html)

### When to Use

In general, anything you can do with an array in NetLogo, you could
also just use a list for. But you may want to consider using an array
instead for speed reasons. Lists and arrays have different performance
 characteristics, so you may be able to make your model run faster by
selecting the appropriate data structure.

Arrays are useful when you need a collection of values whose size is
fixed. You can quickly access or alter any item in an array if you
know its position.

Unlike NetLogo's lists and strings, arrays are "mutable".
That means that you can actually modify them directly,
rather than constructing an altered copy as with lists. If
the array is used in more than one place in your code, any
changes you make will show up everywhere. It's tricky to write
code involving mutable structures and it's easy to make subtle
errors or get surprising results, so we suggest sticking with lists
and strings unless you're certain you want and need mutability.

### Example use of Array Extension

```NetLogo
let a array:from-list n-values 5 [0]
print a
=> {{array: 0 0 0 0 0}}
print array:length a
=> 5
foreach n-values 5 [ [i] -> i ] [ [i] -> array:set a i i * i ]
print a
=> {{array: 0 1 4 9 16}}
print array:item a 0
=> 0
print array:item a 3
=> 9
array:set a 3 50
print a
=> {{array: 0 1 4 50 16}}
```

## Primitives

[`array:from-list`](#arrayfrom-list)
[`array:item`](#arrayitem)
[`array:set`](#arrayset)
[`array:length`](#arraylength)
[`array:to-list`](#arrayto-list)


### `array:from-list`

Reports a new array containing the same items in the same order as the input list.


### `array:item`

Reports the item in the given array with the given index (ranging from zero to the length of the array minus one).


### `array:set`


Sets the item in the given array with the given index (ranging from zero to the length of the array minus one) to the given value.

Note that unlike the `replace-item` primitive for lists, a new array is not created.
The given array is actually modified.



### `array:length`

Reports the length of the given array, that is, the number of items in the array.


### `array:to-list`

Reports a new list containing the same items in the same order as the given array.
